          <pre>Nott Company is proud of its long and prosperous manufacturing heritage. From origins in leather power-transmission belts and classic fire trucks, our business has always been based on dedication to serving customer needs and fostering strong partnerships.

Headquartered in Arden Hills, MN, we serve customers via eight locations in North America.

William S. Nott founded Nott Company in 1879, beginning the business by supplying leather drive belts for the milling and lumber industries. Belts were then made from animal hides using water power from St. Anthony Falls on the Mississippi River, near what is now downtown Minneapolis. By the early 1900s, products evolved from luggage, horse harnesses, and leather dice cups to hand-drawn fire engines, steam pumps, and motorized fire engines. Remnants of the old fire equipment can still be found throughout Nott Company�s offices today.

By the 1960s, the business had evolved and developed two specialty divisions � Rubber Fabrication and Fluid Power. These integral departments provided the design and fabrication of completed rubber products, standard component pieces, total fluid power solutions and engineered systems.

Today, these specialties have expanded into Engineered Materials Solutions, Mobile Fluid Power, Industrial Fluid Power, and Industrial Engineered Solutions. Nott Company and its four divisions now employ hundreds of people across eight locations around the midwest. As an employee-owned (ESOP) company, we are confident that our dedication to growth and change will carry us successfully through the 21st century.

          <pre>Tosh Farms is a family-owned business located in Henry, Tennessee.  The business consists of three separate enterprises working together in a synergistic fashion.  Tosh Farms is a general partnership and our crop production company, Tosh Pork, LLC is our swine production company, and Bacon By Gosh, Inc. is our transportation company.

Tosh Farms currently tends over 18,000 acres of land, of which half is company owned.  The other half of our acreage is leased from 83 different landowners in the Henry area.  Around 2,300 of our acres are irrigated.  We use this land to grow white corn, yellow corn, soybeans, milo, wheat, canola, and barley.  You can learn more about how we care for the land and raise our crops here.  Our administrative team also falls under the Tosh Farms umbrella.  They work in our office in Henry and include our human resources, accounting, senior management, safety, and environmental teams.

Our second company, Tosh Pork, provides care for around 36,000 sows that produce over 930,000 market hogs each year.  We raise these pigs from birth to market.  We currently have ten sow farms where our sows are bred, give birth, and nurse their piglets.  When the piglets reach weaning age (around 3 weeks old), they are transferred to one of our 90 wean-to-finish sites where they share a pen with other pigs their age and are provided a constant source of nutrient-rich feed until they reach market weight.  Our boar stud supplies the genetic material for our herd.  For more information about how we raise pigs, click here.

Additionally, we have a feed mill near our office that employs around 40 people to produce feed for our pigs.  Our feed mill uses corn that is grown by Tosh Farms and local farmers along with ingredients from over 125 other suppliers to produce the approximately 7,000 tons of feed that our pigs consume each week.  As pigs grow, their dietary needs change, so we work with our nutritionist to make sure that their diets are formulated for optimal growth and health at every life stage.  Once our pigs reach optimal market weight, they are marketed to regional packers.  Within Tosh Pork, we also have a construction team that builds new barns for us as our company expands.</pre>
