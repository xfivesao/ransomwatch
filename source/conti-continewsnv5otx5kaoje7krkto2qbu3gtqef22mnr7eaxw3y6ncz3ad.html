Schultze &amp; Braun is one of the most frequently appointed insolvency administrators in Germany.\nWe advise clients on all aspects of restructuring, reorganisation and insolvency. Regionally, nationally and internationally. We develop perspectives for all parties \u2013 for entrepreneurs and employees, as well as for creditors and contractual partners. We also show clients how insolvency can be avoided. Naturally, we also provide business, legal and tax advice, as well as auditing services.\nSchultze &amp; Braun takes responsibility. For the companies and assets entrusted to it, and for the people involved. Our actions are guided by a sense of responsibility and a consistent commitment to finding the best solution for all parties. These values define not just the quality of our work, but also the identity that clients who work with us come to know and appreciate. \nThe success of Schultze &amp; Braun can also be attributed to one other aspect of the very specific way we work: our interdisciplinary approach. In 1975, Dr Eberhard Braun founded Germany\u2019s first interdisciplinary firm of lawyers and tax advisers with a 20-strong team. By 2020, Schultze &amp; Braun had over 600 highly qualified and specialised employees at 40 locations across Europe. This approach works as well today as it did in the past: Teams of lawyers, auditors, tax advisers, business law specialists and businesspeople work hand in hand to provide clients with comprehensive advice on the full range of issues facing them and to offer them the best possible solution for their needs. Whatever phase they find themselves in. From our decades of experience in crisis management and insolvency administration, we know the opportunities that can emerge even in situations that appear hopeless. Our mission is to identify these opportunities, develop plans accordingly and work with our clients to implement them successfully.","url":"\/sCaD9r7l_Schultze_and_Braun","date":1645900784},{"code":"uImgrfqk","view":1787,"highlights":0,"published":0,"links":"","title":"WARNING","address":"","about":"As a response to Western warmongering and American threats to use cyber warfare against the citizens of Russian Federation, the Conti Team is officially announcing that we will use our full capacity to deliver retaliatory measures in case the Western warmongers attempt to target critical infrastructure in Russia or any Russian-speaking region of the world.
