                What is this data:
                The following user data is distributed :
                Name _ Surname _ Email and possibly private passwords
                Company workers and crew data:
                Name _ Nickname _ Number _ and personal photos.

                We are sorry we do not want to publish such personal information but we are in contact with a company that guarantees that there will be an easy solution between us and them not to leak but if not it will be necessary to leak (200G) data perhaps the US companies are not advertising Its own data breach But we replaced it and in the end you will know of course that there is no solution
