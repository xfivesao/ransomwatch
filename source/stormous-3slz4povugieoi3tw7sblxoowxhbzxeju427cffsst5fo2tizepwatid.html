                explain:
                On March 7 Stormous Group found a vulnerability in the company's internal network that resulted in the processing of 199 gigabytes of master data or 200 gigabytes of data.
                What is this data:
                The following user data is distributed :
                Name _ Surname _ Email and possibly private passwords
                Company workers and crew data:
                Name _ Nickname _ Number _ and personal photos.
                Theft of the source code of the famous Unreal Engine!
                We are sorry we do not want to publish such personal information but we are in contact with a company that guarantees that there will be an easy solution between us and them not to leak but if not it will be necessary to leak (200G) data perhaps the US companies are not advertising Its own data breach But we replaced it and in the end you will know of course that there is no solution
                Be on a date tomorrow at 9pm and we will leak important data like crew etc</h2></p>
